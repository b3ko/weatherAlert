weatherAlert
============

a daily text message weather alert.

- uses the weatherunderground API to send daily text messages to registered users with the forecast for the day including high and low temps
- ~~currently just sends a few people a text with the daily high, low and conditions for the day.~~
- ~~currently hard coded to only get data for pittsburgh~~

to do:
------

- ~~set up a mysql server to hold users sms numbers and zipcodes~~
- ~~build a page to have people sign up (gather their email and zip)~~
- ~~add weatherunderground's logo to page~~
- ~~change .py script to connect to database, get user's zip, hit the api and send them the forecast.~~
- add a severe weather alert feature
- add a schedule choice
- look into how to get a "stop" reply via sms to unscribe someone
- fix the wunderground logo so it doesn't look like horrible/follows their usage guidelines
- add validation for registration input 
- add some "marketing" messaging to the page
- ads?
